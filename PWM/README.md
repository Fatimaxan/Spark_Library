# ðŸŸ§ Multi-Digital Pins

### What are Multi-Digital Pins?

Some modules use **more than one digital pin** to work properly. These pins allow the module to send or receive multiple signals at the same timeâ€”for example, controlling multiple LEDs, handling different colors, or measuring distance with precise timing.
