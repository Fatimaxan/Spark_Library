# ðŸŸ© Analog

### What is Analog?

Analog signals are smooth and continuous. They can represent values that change graduallyâ€”like light, pressure, or temperature.  
Analog sensors read these changing values from the physical world and convert them into numbers the microcontroller can understand.

#### Block:
![](../Images/10.png)

This sensor reads **pressure**. When you press on it, it gives a higher value based on how strong the pressure is.
