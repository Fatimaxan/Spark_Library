# ðŸŸ§ Multi-Digital Pins

### What are Multi-Digital Pins?

Some modules use **more than one digital pin** to work correctly. These pins may be used to send or receive multiple signals at the same timeâ€”like controlling several LEDs, reading from multiple buttons, or sending commands to more complex components.
