# ðŸŸ¦ I2C

### What is I2C?

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a communication protocol that allows multiple sensors and modules to connect using just **two wires**â€”one for data (SDA) and one for clock (SCL).  
Itâ€™s especially useful for connecting devices like screens, motor drivers, or environmental sensors that need to **send and receive data**.
